 Good afternoon.
 My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment
 and stable prices for the American people.
 The economy has made good progress toward our dual mandate objectives.
 Inflation has eased from its highs without a significant increase in unemployment.
 That's very good news.
 But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the
 path forward is uncertain.
 I want to assure the American people that we are fully committed to returning inflation
 to our 2 percent goal.
 Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor
 market conditions that benefit all.
 Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to
 reduce our securities holdings.
 Over the past two years, we have significantly tightened the stance of
 monetary policy.
 Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, and we've
 been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation.
 As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving
 our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance.
 I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
 Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.
 GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3 percent.
 For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded at 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well
 as improving supply conditions.
 Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high
 mortgage rates.
 High interest rates also increased.
 The FOMC has a strong economic activity.
 It also appears to have been weighing on business fixed investment.
 The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into
 better balance.
 Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 165,000 jobs per month, a pace that
 is well below that seen a year ago, but still strong.
 The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7 percent.
 Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers.
 The labor force participation rate has moved up on balance over the past year, particularly
 for individuals aged 25-54, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels.
 Nominal wage growth has been easing and job vacancies have declined.
 Although the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available
 workers.
 In tämä 44.3%!
 6.5%!
 notably over the past year, but remains above our longer-run goal of 2%.
 Total PCE prices rose 2.6% over the 12 months ending in December.
 Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9%.
 The lower inflation readings over the second half of last year are welcome,
 but we will need to see continuing evidence to build confidence
 that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.
 Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well-anchored,
 as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters,
 as well as measures from financial markets.
 The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote
 maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
 My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship
 as it erodes purchasing power,
 especially for those least able to meet the higher conditions,
 including the lower costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.
 We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate,
 and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective.
 Over the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5.25 percentage points,
 and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion.
 Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.
 The Committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate
 at 5.25 to 5.5 percent,
 and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.
 We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle,
 and that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected,
 it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year.
 But the economy is not ready.
 But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic,
 and ongoing progress toward our 2% inflation objective is not assured.
 The economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.
 We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer, if appropriate.
 As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued,
 the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals
 are moving into better balance.
 We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much
 could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation
 and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2%.
 At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little
 could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.
 In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate,
 the Committee will carefully assess the incoming data,
 the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.
 The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range
 until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.
 We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.
 We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal
 and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage
 for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
 To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families,
 and businesses across the country.
 Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
 We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment
 and price stability goals.
 Thank you. I look forward to our questions.
 Thanks for taking our questions.
 Obviously, in the statement and just in your remarks there,
 you note that you don't want to cut interest rates without greater confidence
 that inflation is coming down fully.
 I wonder, what do you need to see at this point to gain that confidence?
 And as you make those decisions,
 how are you weighing recent strong growth in consumer spending data
 against the sort of solid inflation progress you've been seeing?
 Sorry, say that last part again.
 How are you weighing the growth that you've been seeing
 with data and consumption data,
 which have been surprisingly strong against inflation data?
 Okay. So what are we looking for to get greater confidence?
 Let me say that we have confidence.
 We're looking for greater confidence
 that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%.
 Implicitly, we do have confidence and it has been increasing,
 but we want to get greater confidence.
 What do we want to see?
 We want to see more good data.
 It's not that we're looking for better data.
 We're looking at continuation of the good data that we've been seeing.
 And a good example is inflation.
 So we have six months of good inflation data.
 The question really is that six months of good inflation data,
 is it sending us a true signal that we are in fact on a path,
 a sustainable path down to 2% inflation?
 That's the question.
 And the answer will come from some more data that's also good data.
 It's not that the six-month data isn't low enough.
 It is.
 It's just a question of can we take that with confidence
 that we're moving sustainably down to 2%.
 That's really what we're thinking about.
 In terms of growth, we've had strong growth.
 I mean, if you take a step back, we've had strong growth,
 very strong growth last year going right into the fourth quarter.
 And yet we've had a very strong labor market,
 and we've had inflation coming down.
 So I think whereas a year ago we were thinking that we needed to see
 some softening in economic activity, that hasn't been the case.
 So I think we look at stronger growth.
 We don't look at it as a problem.
 I think at this point we want to see strong growth.
 We want to see a strong labor market.
 We're not looking for a weaker labor market.
 We're looking for inflation to continue to come down
 as it has been coming down for the last six months.
 And I'm sorry if I could just follow up very quickly.
 When you say that you want to make sure that it's a true signal,
 is there anything that you're seeing in the data that makes you doubt
 that it's a true signal at this stage?
 No, I think I would say it seems to be the likely case
 that we will achieve that confidence,
 but we have to achieve it, and we haven't yet.
 And so, I mean, it's a good story.
 We have six months of good inflation.
 But you can, and you know this, you can look behind those numbers
 and you can see that a lot of it's been coming from goods inflation,
 for example, and goods inflation running significantly negative.
 It's a reasonable assumption that over time goods inflation will flatten out,
 probably approximate zero.
 That would mean the services sectors would have to contribute more.
 So, in other words, what we care about is the aggregate number,
 not so much the composition.
 But we just need to see more.
 That's where we are as a committee.
 We need to see more evidence that sort of confirms what we think we're seeing
 and that tells us that we are on, gives us confidence that we're on a path to,
 a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.
 Nick.
 Nick Timros of the Wall Street Journal.
 Chair Powell, it seems to me you raised rates rapidly over the last two years
 for two reasons.
 One was the risk of a wage price bump.
 Two, there were risks of inflation expectations becoming unanchored.
 This morning's ECI report for the fourth quarter shows private sector payroll growth
 running at a sub-4 percent pace.
 Inflation expectations are very close to where they were before the inflation emergency
 of the last three years.
 And given that you appear to have substantially cut off these two tail risks
 and that you've judged here today current policy is well into restrictive territory,
 what good reason is there to keep policy rates above 5 percent?
 Are you really going to learn more waiting six weeks versus three months from now
 that you have avoided those two risks?
 So, as you know, almost every participant on the committee does believe
 that it will be appropriate to reduce rates and partly for the reasons that you say.
 You know, we feel like inflation is coming down.
 Growth has been strong.
 The labor market is strong.
 What we're trying to do is identify a place where we're really confident about inflation
 getting back down to 2 percent so that we can then begin the process of dialing back
 the restrictive level.
 So overall, I think people do believe, and as you know, the median participant wrote down
 three rate cuts this year.
 But I think to get to that place where we feel comfortable starting the process,
 we need some confirmation that inflation is in fact coming down.
 Sustainably to 2 percent.
 If I could ask differently, if you hold rates high as inflation moderates as it has been,
 target rates will exceed the prescriptions of the Taylor ruler experience.
 What would be the reasoning for holding rates higher than the levels recommended by those rules
 in the current instance?
 Well, look, I think, as you know, we consult a range of Taylor rules and non-Taylor kind of rules.
 We consult them regularly.
 They're in our TEAL book.
 And they're there.
 And they're in all the materials that we look at.
 But, you know, I don't think we've ever been at a place where we were setting policy by them.
 And depending on the rule, it will tell you different things.
 There are many different formulations.
 Another way to think about it is, implicitly, is so in theory, of course, real rates go up
 if holding all else equal as inflation comes down.
 But that doesn't mean we can mechanically adjust policy as real rates go up.
 It doesn't mean that at all because, for one thing, we don't know.
 We look at more than just the Fed funds rate.
 We look at broadly financial conditions.
 But in addition, we don't know with great confidence where the neutral rate of interest is at any given time.
 But that also doesn't mean that we wait around for, to see, you know, the economy turn down because that would be too late.
 So we're really in a risk management mode of managing the risk, as I mentioned in my opening remarks,
 managing the risk that we move too soon and move too quickly.
 And I think to move, which is where almost everyone on the committee is, is in favor of moving rates down this year.
 But the timing of that is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent.
 Howard.
 Hi.
 Thanks, Chair Bell.
 I'd like you to key in on the use of the word in the statement that inflation still remains elevated.
 You've pledged to cut rates before inflation reached 2 percent.
 So that implies that there's some sort of intermediate step here on inflation,
 and that a cut would be consequent with a change in the statement language that inflation remains elevated.
 What's the step down from there?
 Yeah.
 I don't know that we've worked out the particular statement language and that kind of thing.
 I would just say, if you look at where 12-month inflation is, and it's, you know, it's still well above.
 Core is 2.9 percent, for example, 12 months, which is way down from where it was.
 Very, very positive development.
 Very fast decline.
 And, you know, the case is likely that it will continue to come down.
 So that's where it is.
 But, you know, we're wanting to see, you know, more data.
 So if I could follow up on that.
 The statement allows that you want greater confidence on inflation falling before you cut.
 But it doesn't mention the other side of the mandate.
 A slide in employment.
 Would a slide in employment also bring you to the point of cutting rates?
 Yes.
 So let me say that we're not looking for that.
 It's not something we're looking for.
 But, yes, if you think about, you know, in the base case, the economy is performing well.
 The labor market remains strong.
 If we saw an unexpected weakening in certainly in the labor market, that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner.
 Absolutely.
 And if we saw inflation being stickier.
 Or higher.
 Or those sorts of things, we would argue for moving later.
 In the base case, though, where the economy is healthy and we have, you know, we have ongoing growth, solid growth.
 We have a strong labor market.
 We have inflation coming down.
 That's what people are writing their SEP around.
 And in that case, what we're saying is based on that, we think we can and should take advantage of that and be careful as we approach that question of when to begin to dial back in.
 Claire Jones, Financial Times.
 Just to circle back to the greater confidence aspect of the statement.
 There's been a lot of unanimity in recent meetings.
 I'm just wondering, going forward, when it comes to all needing greater confidence, is the unanimity or at least consensus among FOMC members about what the FOMC is going to do in the future?
 I mean, I think it's a great question.
 I think it's a great question.
 I think it's a great question.
 I think it's a great question.
 I think it's a great question.
 I think it's a great question.
 I think it's a great question.
 I think it's a great question.
 I think it's a great question.
 I think it's a great question.
 I think it's a great question.
 I'm just wondering what the threshold for that greater confidence is.
 I'm just wondering what the threshold for that greater confidence is.
 And if not, could you maybe tell us a little bit about the discussion today on, you know, what the variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence to cut rates?
 And if not, could you maybe tell us a little bit about the discussion today on, you know, what the variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence to cut rates?
 And if not, could you maybe tell us a little bit about the discussion today on, you know, what the variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence to cut rates?
 And also, if there was any variation on how quickly that greater confidence threshold could be reached.
 how quickly that greater confidence threshold could be reached thank you we're not we're not
 really at that stage you know we're we're there was no proposal to cut rates uh some people did
 you know talk about their view of the rate path i would point you to the scp uh as as you know
 as good evidence of where people are although it is it is one cycle later so you know we are we're
 not we're not at a place of of really working out those kinds of details because we weren't actively
 considering you know a moving moving the federal funds rate down i will say there's a there is a
 wide disparity a healthy disparity of views and you see that in public public statements in the
 minutes and the transcripts when they're released every five years so we do have a healthy set of
 differences and i think that's actually essential for making good policy we're also able to reach
 agreement generally
 because we listen to each other we we compromise and even though not everybody loves what we do
 they're able to for the most part able to join in to me that's a that's a well-functioning public
 institution rachel hi chair pal rachel siegel from the washington post thanks for taking our
 questions so over the past few years there have been all these real-time indicators that helped
 us gain a sharper understanding of where the economy was like open table data or office
 attendance you've talked about vacancies
 in the past and i'm wondering at the start of this year what might be on that dashboard for you
 that's giving you the clearest picture of the economy including on rents if you could touch on
 that including rent rent costs yeah well so we're not you know it's not the pandemic so we can
 actually rely on more more traditional forms people are working they're getting wages and the
 economy is largely reopened and is broadly normalizing as you see so i wouldn't say we're
 looking at that that sort of more innovative
 data as much you know you point to rent so of course we follow the components of inflation
 very carefully which would be goods inflation i talked about that a little bit you mentioned
 housing inflation so the question is when will these lower market rents find their way into
 measured grand stage as measured measured in pce inflation and we think that's coming
 and we know it's coming it's just a question of when and and how big it will be so
 that's in in everyone's forecast i would say so that will that will help but at the
 same time we think goods inflation will probably it's been giving a lot of disinflation to the
 effort and probably that declines over time but it may well have some some more time to run you
 know these the supply chains are not perfectly back to where they were in addition it takes time
 for the healing process to get into prices so there may be still a tailwind we'll find out with
 with that so we look at the things that relate to our mandate very carefully and as you would imagine
 i guess just as a quick follow-up do you feel comfortable at this point saying the economy has
 reached a soft landing or is that part of looking for more confidence no i wouldn't i wouldn't say
 we've achieved that and i think we have we have a ways to go inflation is still you know core
 inflation is still well above target on a 12-month basis 12 months is our our target certainly i'm
 encouraged and we're encouraged by the progress but uh you know we're we're um we're not we're
 not declaring victory at all at this point we think we have a ways to go steve thank you mr chairman
 you've
 said that you would know the neutral rate by its works so i'm wondering what you could tell me
 how do you believe the neutral rate is working we're telling you
 right now that growth is stronger in other words how much is the economy really being
 restrained right now by the current funds rate and how much restraint does it really
 need additionally if inflation is still coming down so it's i think you do see in
 the interest sensitive parts of the economy you do see for example housing you see the
 inflationary effects you do your your second question though really i think is important and
 that is a lot of this has come through uh a lot of the disinflationary processes come through the
 healing of supply chains and also of the labor market so you've seen that you know that other
 set of factors is really different from other cycles and has brought that working with tighter
 tighter policy which has enabled the supply side to recover i think is that that mixture has been
 really important and i think it's really important to think about this um so no we really do think
 that we're having an effect broadly across the economy i would point to the interest sensitive
 uh uh parts of the economy as well as as spending generally um but it's a it's a joint story it's a
 complicated story but how much restraint are you actually imparting to the economy would you say
 relative to the neutral rate it's so i think it's it's of course you know that it's not something
 you can identify with any precision but if you
 would be to take the nominal rate 5.3 let's say and subtract a sort of a forward measure of
 inflation if you do that and there are many many ways to calculate that neutral rate but that's
 what i like to do and you're going to get to something that is materially above mainstream
 estimates of neutrality of the neutral rate you will but at the same time you look at the economy
 and you say this is an economy that grew 3.1 percent last year and and you say what does that
 tell you about the neutral rate what's happening
 though is the supply side has been recovering in the middle of this so that that won't go on
 forever so a lot of the growth we're seeing is not is it isn't just a tug of war between
 between interest rates and demand you're getting you know more activity because of the of labor
 market healing and supply chains healing so i so i think the question is when that peters out
 i think the you know the the restriction will show up probably more more sharply
 um thank you sorry uh thanks for taking the questions mr chairman um you mentioned earlier
 we're not seeking a weaker labor market i think the the issue said can you talk a little bit more
 about that do you think the neighbor market now is back to quote unquote normal and that
 the we can uh achieve uh the inflation target without wage gains coming back down to
 what they were
 pre-pandemic even with today's eci levels they were still above those pre-pandemic i think the
 labor market by many measures is at or nearing normal but not totally back to normal and you
 pointed to uh one or more of them so i think you know job openings are not quite back to where they
 were wages or wage increases rather are not quite back to where they to where they would need to be
 in the longer run i would look at it this way though um the the economy is broadly normal
 normalizing
 and so is the labor market and that process will probably take some time so wage setting
 is something that happens it's it's you know probably will take a couple of years to get
 all the way back and that's okay that's okay but we do see you saw today's eci reading
 you know the evidence is that that wage increases are still at a
 healthy level very healthy level but they're gradually moving back to levels that would be
 more associated given assumptions about productivity are more typically associated with two
 or three percent inflation it's it's an ongoing process a healthy one and and you know i think
 we're moving in the right direction so that process can continue without a weakening of the
 labor market basically you say i think the labor market is it i don't know if it's rebalancing
 clearly that the there was a uh fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers and supply
 at the beginning of the pandemic so we lost several million workers at the beginning of the
 pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force
 the economy reopened you remember 2021 you had a severe labor shortage and it was just it was
 everywhere the panic on the part of businesses couldn't couldn't find people so what's happened
 is we expected labor the labor supply labor market to come back quickly and it didn't and in 2022
 was a disappointing year and you know we were kind of thinking well maybe we won't get it back
 and then 2023 we did as you know so labor force participation came back strongly in 23 and so did
 immigration immigration came to a halt during the pandemic so and so those two forces have
 significantly lowered the temperature in the labor market to will is still a very strong labor market
 it's still a good labor market for wages and for finding a job but it's getting back into balance
 and that's what we want to see and you know one great way to look at that is what's happening with
 with wage increases and you see it now across the the major things that we that we track it isn't
 every quarter but over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and
 all there's a clear trend still at high levels but back down to where would be what would be
 consistent with with where we were before the pandemic and with two percent inflation chris
 hi uh chris rugaber at associated press thank you i wanted to follow up on rich's question
 uh it sounded like you suggested that uh you're not worried about faster growth so much so wanted
 to see if you're seeing anything that suggests that inflation could re-accelerate from here
 and it sounds like you're saying you're not worried that uh
 solid growth from here on out poses any risk to inflation
 thank you no i think that that is a risk the risk that inflation would uh would reaccelerate i think
 the greater risk is that it would that it would stabilize at a level meaningfully above two percent
 that's that's to me more likely of course if if if inflation were to
 surprise by moving back up that would we would have to respond to that and that would be a surprise at
 this point but i have to tell you that's why we keep our options open here and why we're not you
 know rushing so um i think both of those are risks but i think the more likely risk is the one that i
 mentioned which is you you've had six good months very good months but what what's really going to
 shake out here what you know where what will when we look back what will we see will inflation have
 dipped and then come back up are the last six months flattered by by factors that are that are
 one-off factors that won't repeat themselves we don't think so we don't you know that's not
 what we think but that's the question we are asking we have to ask and we want to get comfort
 on that and just one quick follow-up uh governor waller had mentioned the uh revisions that are
 coming on february 9th for the cpi data is that something you're watching as well and if if we
 see those revisions fairly minor uh is that going to give you more confidence uh where things are
 going we'll just have to see yeah we'll we look at those last year was a
 was it a surprise
 michael mckee bloomberg radio and television if you don't want to use the term soft landing
 would you say at least that from your point of view now the other scenario of a hard landing
 caused by the fed is off the table or the risks have diminished uh very much and as you mentioned
 below two percent inflation for on a three-month basis core pce's been running at 1.5 percent and
 there are those on wall street who think that if you maintain the level of restriction you have
 right now you could end up with inflation running below your target uh how do you see that
 so how do you your first question how to describe where we are so i guess i would just say this
 executive summary would be growth is the number one thing
 is solid to strong over the course of last year.
 The labor market, 3.7% unemployment,
 indicates that the labor market is strong.
 We've had just about two years now of unemployment under 4%.
 That hasn't happened in 50 years,
 so it's a good labor market.
 And we've seen inflation come down.
 We've talked about that.
 So we've got six months of good inflation data
 and an expectation that there's more to come.
 So this is a good situation.
 Let's be honest.
 This is a good economy.
 But what's the outlook?
 That's looking in the review.
 The outlook, we do expect growth to moderate.
 Of course, we have expected it for some time,
 and it hasn't happened.
 But we do expect that it will moderate
 as supply chain and labor market normalization
 runs its course.
 The labor market is rebalancing, as I mentioned.
 Job creation has slowed.
 The base of job growth has narrowed.
 And of course, 12-month inflation is above target
 and getting down.
 Closer to target is not guaranteed,
 but we do seem to be getting on track for that.
 So those are the risks and questions we have to answer.
 But overall, this is a pretty good picture.
 It is a good picture.
 Your second question was, sorry.
 Could you get inflation that is below target,
 end up with inflation below target,
 and you have to do something about that?
 So the thing is, we're not looking for inflation
 to tap the 2% base once.
 We're looking for it to settle out over time at 2%.
 And the same thing is true.
 If we have a month or two of lower,
 and we have that now, of inflation that's annualized
 at a lower level, that wouldn't be good.
 We're not looking to have inflation anchor below 2%.
 We're looking to have it anchor at 2%.
 So if we do face those circumstances,
 then we'll have to deal with that.
 I think as of now, the question,
 we want to take advantage of this situation and finish the job.
 We want to take advantage of this situation and finish the job.
 We want to take advantage of this situation and finish the job
 on inflation while keeping the labor market strong.
 Edward.
 Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking this.
 So as I've heard from some district Fed presidents,
 is it, in your view, a little premature to think
 that rate cuts are right around the corner?
 And then when we do see that first rate cut,
 is that, should we interpret that as the beginning
 of a rate cut cycle, or is it a one-off?
 So I'll point to that language on your first question.
 We included that language in the statement to signal, clearly,
 that with strong growth, strong labor market,
 inflation coming down, the committee intends
 to move carefully as to when we consider when to begin
 to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place.
 So if we take that to the current context,
 the current context, we're going to be data-dependent.
 We're going to be looking
 at this meeting by meeting, based on the meeting today,
 I would tell you that I don't think it's likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that, but that's to be seen.
 So I wouldn't call, you know, when you ask me about in the near term, I'm hearing that as March.
 I would say I don't think that's probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base case.
 Then your second question is?
 On the, is this the start of a, when we see a cut, is it the start of a cutting cycle or could it just be a one-off?
 You know, that's going to depend on the data.
 The whole thing is this is going to depend on the data.
 We're going to be looking at the economic data as it affects the outlook and the balance of risks, and we're going to make our decisions based on that.
 And it could wind up, you know, we'll have another SEP at the March meeting and people will write down what they think,
 but in the end, it's really going to depend on how the economy evolves.
 We talked about there are risks that would cause us.
 There are risks that would cause us to go slower, for example, stronger inflation, more persistent inflation.
 There are risks that would cause us to go, if they happened, that would cause us to go faster and sooner,
 and that would be a weakening in the labor market or, for that matter, very, very persuasive lower inflation.
 Those are the kinds of things.
 So we're just going to be reacting to the data.
 That's really the only way we can do this.
 Victoria.
 Hi.
 Victoria Guido with Politico.
 Could you talk a little bit more about?
 You know, you've mentioned multiple times about, you know, the level of wage growth that's consistent with 2% inflation.
 We've obviously seen, you know, you were talking about ECI this morning in which it's cooled a little bit,
 but still sort of above what you wanted to see.
 Growth has been very strong.
 How much of those numbers do you attribute to productivity,
 and do you see that productivity as sort of just temporary because of the factors,
 the labor and supply chain factors you were talking about,
 or do you think that productivity growth?
 Well, we'll fade over time.
 So this is a really interesting question, and I think my own view is I think if you look back to the pandemic,
 you saw a spike in productivity as workers were laid off and activity didn't decline as fast.
 And then you saw a deep trough of productivity.
 And then over the last year, you saw high productivity last year in 23.
 I think we're we're basically in the throes.
 Of getting through the pandemic economy.
 And the question will be, what is it that has changed the, you know,
 the productivity tends to be based on, you know, fundamental aspects of our economy.
 And is there is there a case?
 Will it be the case that we come out of this more productive, more on a sustained basis?
 And I don't know.
 I don't know what would it take?
 It would take, you know, people talk about AI, but I would.
 My guess is that we may shake out and be back where we were because I'm not sure.
 I.
 See, work from home doesn't seem like it's a big productivity increase or AI, artificial intelligence generative may be, but probably not in the short run, probably maybe in the longer run.
 So I'm not I'm not seeing why it would.
 But, you know, right now, I would say the productivity is kind of what falls out of the broader forces that are driving people in and out of the labor force and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed.
 Right.
 So would that be behind?
 I don't know why we've seen such strong growth, but we've also seen inflation fall that maybe there's just a higher level of productivity.
 That's one way to look at it.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Nancy.
 Hi, Chair Powell, Nancy Marshall, again, sir, with Marketplace.
 I want to ask a little bit more about housing.
 I'm wondering how closely are you watching rent and housing prices as you evaluate whether and when to cut rates?
 And it seems like housing prices are not coming down as quickly as you expected.
 So when we think about, you know, our our statutory goals are maximum employment and price stability, and that's what we're targeting.
 We're not targeting housing price, inflation, the cost of housing or any of those things.
 Those are very important things for people's lives.
 But they're not.
 You know, those are not the things we're targeting.
 We're also well aware that when we cut rates at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, the housing housing industry was helped more than any other industry.
 industry and when we raise rates the housing industry can be hurt because it's a very
 interest sensitive sector on top of that we have longer run problems with the availability of
 housing you know we have a built-up set of cities and and you know people are moving further and
 further out so there's there hasn't been enough housing built and these are not these are not
 things that we have any tools to address but you know it where it comes into play very specifically
 in our work is inflation which is a combination it's really rental inflation you're taking
 owner's equivalent rent and then actual rent paid by tenants and you're you're running that through
 the cpi calculation or the pce calculation the one we look at and what that's telling you is that
 market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will show up in
 inflation over time it has to as long as that remains the case so and just real quick
 quick what is your response to the letter that was sent to you by some members of congress
 asking the fed to lower interest rates to make housing more affordable my response is what i
 started with which is that our our job the job congress has given us is price stability and
 maximum employment price stability is absolutely essential for people's lives most importantly for
 not most importantly most mostly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum who are living
 at the edges
 at the margins and so someone for someone like that high inflation
 about in the in the necessities of life right away you're in trouble whereas even middle class
 people have some you know some scope to absorb higher costs so we have to get it's our job it's
 what society has asked us to do is to get inflation down the tools that we use to do it
 are interest rates so that's how we think about that
 courtney brown from
 thanks um can you give us some insight into whether the committee discussed
 the possibility of slowing balance sheet runoff in the months ahead yes
 so
 i would start by saying that balance sheet runoff so far has gone very well and as the process has
 continued you know we're getting to that time where questions are beginning to come into greater
 focus about the pace of runoff and
 and all that so at this meeting we did have some discussion of the balance sheet and we're planning
 to begin in-depth discussions uh of balance sheet issues at our next meeting in march so those those
 questions are all coming into scope now and we're focusing on them but we're we're at the beginning
 of that process i would say quick follow-up is it the case that the fed would decide to lower rates
 and make adjustments to the balance sheet runoff in tandem yes we do we see those as independent
 tools and so they don't for example if you're if you're normalizing policy you might be reducing
 rates but continuing to run off the balance sheet in both cases that's normalization but from a
 strict monetary policy standpoint you could say we're loosening and one with tightening so that
 that could happen it's not something we're planning or thinking about but right now we're
 thinking about getting to a place where we're going to see the balance sheet runoff to continue
 we're watching it carefully and and uh as i said we'll be looking into that as a committee starting
 in march thank you
 so i'm in urbanovich with the economist thank you chair powell um you've mentioned uh six good
 months of inflation data without not being enough to build up confidence based on your previous
 response that your base case is you probably wouldn't start easing yet in march the implication
 is that eight good months might not be enough either roughly how many months do you think you
 might need of good inflation data to be to be confident yeah i'm not in a position to put a
 number on it i'm just going to say
 um it's and it's not that we don't have any confidence we we have growing confidence but
 not to the point where we where we feel like it's a highly consequential decision to start
 the process of uh of dialing back on restriction and we want to get that right and we feel like
 the strong economy strong labor market inflation coming down it gives us the ability to do that
 we think that's the best way we can serve the public because uh ultimately we we're we've made
 a lot of progress on inflation we just want to make sure that we do get the job done and we're
 going to do it in a sustainable way that's how we're thinking about it in terms of when that'll
 be you know that that'll all come out of our communications uh and uh you know we won't we
 won't keep that a secret
 hi chair pal um evan riser with m and i market news um can you uh explain a little bit more on
 what you're um considering when tapering qt do you need to see the overnight reverse repo facility
 all the way down to zero or is that a good idea i think it's a good idea i think it's a good idea
 or is it something that you can start with a couple hundred billion dollars there not a decision
 that we've made but i i wouldn't think we'd we'd be we wouldn't be taking a position that's got to
 go to zero i mean if it were to stabilize at a different level but that's that's not a decision
 that we've made that's that's what we'll be talking about at the march meeting a whole range
 of issues uh will be briefed up in the committee we'll get into get into all of the issues that
 that will be arising over the course of the next let's say year or so great
 thanks greg rob from market watch that chair bali one change gears a little bit in the
 presidential primary campaign that's been going on for the last nine months or so your name has
 come up often and many republican candidates had said that they probably wouldn't want to give you
 a third term so i wanted to give you a chance to talk about that do you want another term you've had
 on the fed what's your stance on that i don't have a stance on that i am it's not something
 i'm focused on for the time being as i'm a member of the fed i'm not a member of the fed i'm a member
 focused on doing our jobs.
 This year is going to be a highly consequential year
 for the Fed and for monetary policy,
 and we're, all of us, very buckled down,
 focused on doing our jobs.
 Jennifer.
 Thank you, Chair Powell.
 Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance.
 As you mentioned, core PCE has been running at 1.9%
 over the past six months,
 and you guys are actually expecting core inflation
 higher this year at 2.4% compared to that six-month measure.
 Given that forecast and that the median
 is for three rate cuts this year,
 what happens if inflation stays where it's been
 over the last six months for the next six months?
 So, you know, we're gonna do,
 we'll update our inflation forecasts at the next meeting.
 You referred to the December meeting.
 That's, you know, three months old,
 so it might be lower now, given the data we've gotten.
 So, look.
 As I mentioned, we're gonna be reacting to the data.
 If we get very strong inflation data and it kicks back up,
 then we'll go slower or later or both.
 If we got really good inflation data soon,
 that would matter for both the,
 that would tell us that we could go sooner
 and perhaps go faster.
 So we're just gonna be,
 and that, but of course, we'll weigh that
 with all the other factors.
 We're setting policy based on the totality of the data.
 But just to follow,
 if inflation stays, if inflation stays, if inflation stays,
 where it is currently,
 that would probably mean that the real interest rate
 becomes more restrictive.
 Would that mean you'd have to trim more, perhaps,
 than you already have factored in?
 I think if we came to the view that inflation were,
 that the six-month inflation numbers,
 which are very close to two, were in PCE world,
 if we thought that is really where we're gonna be,
 then yes, our policy would be in a different place.
 It would.
 But, you know, that's the whole point,
 is we're trying to get comfortable and gain confidence.
 Gain confidence that that is where,
 that inflation is on a sustainable bad path,
 down to two percent or toward two percent.
 Daniel.
 Hi, Chair Powell.
 Daniel Davis, Agence France-Presse.
 I just wondered if I could get your comment
 on the recent consumer confidence data.
 It seems to suggest that consumers are sort of moving
 towards a much more optimistic view of the economy.
 I just wonder, is it fair to say that they're moving
 towards where the Fed appears to have been in recent years?
 Or, you know, in recent months?
 And, you know, do you think that inflation
 and falling inflation perhaps has played a role in that?
 And what challenges do you see going forward?
 Thank you.
 Yeah, so it's been interesting
 that confidence surveys have been weak at a time
 when unemployment has been low, very low,
 historically low for a couple of years.
 But nonetheless, that's been the case.
 And we've asked ourselves why that is.
 And, you know, one obvious answer,
 we don't pretend to have perfect wisdom on this, is,
 but one obvious answer, is, that, the prices are going up.
 They're going up.
 They're going up.
 They're going up.
 They're going up.
 They're going up.
 They're going up.
 They're going up.
 The price level is high.
 So prices went up much more than 2 percent per year
 for a couple of years.
 And people are going to the store.
 And they're paying much more for the basics of life
 than they were two years ago, three years ago.
 And they're not happy about it.
 And it's fine that inflation's coming down.
 But the prices they're paying are still high.
 So that is what, that has to be some part
 of why people are unhappy.
 And they're right to be unhappy.
 You know, this is why we need to keep price stability.
 It's why we need to do our jobs.
 It's so that people don't have to deal with things like this.
 In terms of, you're right, in recent surveys,
 a couple of, you've seen a couple of significant increases
 in consumer confidence or happiness with the economy.
 I guess that's a good thing.
 That can support spending, can support economic activity.
 There's some evidence of that.
 But you're right, it is a fact that we have seen a,
 you know, meaningful increase.
 I think levels of confidence are still, maybe,
 maybe not as high as they've been at various times.
 But it's, they certainly have come up.
 Thank you for taking our questions.
 Brian Mendocino in business.
 Committee members have said they'd like to meet with business leaders
 and stakeholders in person to learn more about the economy
 in real time, given that some data is subject to large revisions,
 the issue of seasonal adjustments being thrown off balance,
 and many readings of the economy being quarterly.
 So did any members say they've learned anything
 now you're reflected in the data?
 Or have you yourself learned anything through anecdotal evidence
 that hasn't been captured in the data yet?
 Well, yes, I'm a big believer that yes.
 So we do meet with outside groups who come from all different parts
 of the economy, and I always feel like you, I mean, I spent most of my life
 in the private sector looking at companies, individual companies,
 individual management teams, and then building out from that.
 And so starting with GDP data is,
 and working into what's actually affecting people's lives is challenging.
 It's very hard.
 So I really like anecdotal data.
 In addition, as you know, the 12 reserve banks have really the best network of anyone
 that in all their districts they're talking to, you know, not just the business community,
 but the educational, medical, you know, non-profit community.
 They have arms into all of that.
 And so when they come back, that's what goes into the Beige Book.
 But they come back.
 And what?
 Each of them, you know, each of them, you know, each of them, you know, each of them, you know,
 each reserve bank president does is during the outlook go-around, they'll say,
 in my district, and they'll talk about 100 conversations.
 Not, they won't talk about, they will give you input based on 100 conversations
 that they've had with people of all different walks.
 And it's, I personally find it very helpful in understanding what's going on.
 And also, I think you hear things before they show up in the data sometimes.
 Did any of them notice slowing economy?
 Based on what they've heard from, like, their district?
 Yes. I mean, if you, if you look back at the last, not this Beige Book,
 but the one before, it was more, there was a lot of slower activity.
 I think that the, what you're hearing now is, is things are picking up a bit.
 You're hearing, not, not in every district and not every, every person that we talked to,
 but your, your overall, it feels like you're hearing things picking up at the margin.
 So, that's what comes through.
 Let's go to Jeff Cox for the last question.
 Thank you, sir.
 Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.
 Just kind of looking to put it all together.
 You talked about basically the economy looking strong with 3.3 percent annualized growth
 in the fourth quarter.
 Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to you now than any inflation threat might?
 That, you know, you're in a position, in other words, to keep rates elevated as long
 as the economy stays strong and you're more, you're more tilted towards that?
 And then also, perhaps, are you worried at all
 that the economy's maybe a little bit more, you know, a little bit more, you know, a little bit more?
 Or is it a little too strong right now and that inflation could come back at some point?
 I'm not so worried about that.
 You know, it's, again, we've had inflation come down without a slow economy and without,
 you know, important increases in, in unemployment.
 And there's no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process if it's going to continue.
 So, I, I am, you know, I think, I think declining inflation,
 continued declines in inflation are really the main thing we're looking at.
 Of course, we want that.
 We want the labor market to remain strong, too.
 We don't have a growth mandate.
 We've got a, a maximum employment mandate and a, and a price stability mandate.
 And those are the two things we look at.
 Growth only matters to the extent it influences our achievement of those two, of those two mandates.
 Thank you very much.
