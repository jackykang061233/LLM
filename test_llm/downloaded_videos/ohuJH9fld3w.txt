 Good afternoon, everyone.
 Welcome. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused
 on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment
 and stable prices for the American people.
 We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing,
 and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back
 down to our 2 percent goal.
 Price stability is the responsibility
 of the Federal Reserve.
 Without price stability, the economy does not work
 for anyone.
 In particular, without price stability,
 we will not achieve a sustained period
 of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.
 Since early last year,
 the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance
 of monetary policy.
 We have raised our policy interest rate by 5
 and a quarter percentage points and have continued
 to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.
 The stance of policy is restrictive,
 meaning that we will not be able to achieve
 our goals.
 We have also been aware that tight policy is putting downward
 pressure on economic activity and inflation,
 and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.
 Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged
 and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.
 Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties
 and risks we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully.
 We will make decisions about the extent
 of additional policy firming
 and how long policy will remain restrictive based
 on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook,
 and the balance of risks.
 I'll have more to say about monetary policy
 after briefly reviewing economic developments.
 Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been
 expanding at a strong pace and well above earlier expectations.
 In the third quarter, real GDP is estimated
 to have risen an outsized annual rate of 4.9 percent,
 boosted by a surge in consumer spending.
 After picking up somewhat over the summer,
 activity in the housing sector has flattened out
 and remains well below levels of a year ago,
 largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.
 Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing
 on business fixed investment.
 The labor market remains tight, but supply
 and demand conditions continue to come into better balance.
 Over the past three months,
 payroll job gains averaged 266,000 jobs per month,
 a strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year.
 The unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent.
 Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase
 in the supply of workers.
 The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year,
 particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years,
 and immigration has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels.
 Nominal wage growth has shown some signs
 of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.
 Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed,
 labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.
 Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
 Total PCE prices rose 3.4 percent over the 12 months ending
 in September, excluding the volatile food
 and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.7 percent.
 Inflation has moderated since the middle of last year,
 and readings over the summer were quite favorable.
 But a few months of good data are only the beginning
 of what it will take to build confidence
 that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.
 The process of getting inflation sustainably
 down to 2 percent has a long way to go.
 Despite elevated inflation,
 longer-term inflation expectations appear
 to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range
 of surveys of how the economy is doing.
 The first is inflation.
 It is a very important factor in the growth
 of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures
 from financial markets.
 The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate
 to promote maximum employment and stable prices
 for the American people.
 My colleagues and I are acutely aware
 that high inflation imposes significant hardship
 as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able
 to meet the higher costs of essentials like food,
 housing, and transportation.
 We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses
 to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed
 to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.
 As I noted earlier, since early last year,
 we have raised our policy rate by 5.25 percentage points,
 and we have decreased our securities holdings
 by more than $1 trillion.
 Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting
 downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.
 The Committee decided at today's meeting
 to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25
 to 5.5 percent, and to continue the process
 of significantly reducing our securities holdings.
 We are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy
 that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably
 down to 2 percent over time,
 and to keeping policy restrictive
 until we are confident that inflation is
 on a path to that objective.
 We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience
 of economic growth and demand for labor.
 Evidence of growth persistently above potential, or that tightness
 in the labor market is no longer easing, could put further progress
 on inflation at risk, and could warrant further tightening
 of monetary policy.
 Financial conditions have tightened significantly
 in recent months, driven by higher longer-term bond yields,
 among other factors.
 Because persistent changes
 in financial conditions can have implications for the path
 of monetary policy, we monitor financial developments closely.
 In light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come,
 the Committee is proceeding carefully.
 We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting,
 based on the totality of the incoming data
 and their implications for the outlook and for economic activity
 and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.
 In determining the extent of additional policy firming,
 that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time,
 the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening
 of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity
 and inflation, and economic and financial developments.
 We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal
 and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
 Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-potential growth
 and some softening of labor market conditions.
 Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage
 for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
 To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities,
 families, and businesses across the country.
 Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
 We at the Fed will do everything we can
 to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.
 Thank you.
 And I look forward to your questions.

 Thank you, Chair Powell, for doing this.
 To what you referenced, the rise in long-term bond yields,
 to what degree did that supplant action by the Fed at this meeting?
 CHAIR POWELL.
 Thanks for your question.
 So I'll talk about bond yields, but I want to take a second
 and just sort of set the broader context in which we're looking at that.
 So if you could just-.

 Inflation has been coming down, but it's still running well above our 2 percent target.
 The labor market has been rebalancing, but it's still very tight by many measures.
 GDP growth has been strong, although many forecasters are forecasting,
 and they have been forecasting, that it will slow.
 As for the Committee, we are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that
 is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time,
 and we're not confident yet that we have achieved such a stance.
 So that is the broader context into which this, the strong economy and all the things I said,
 that's the context in which we're looking at this question of rates.
 So obviously we're monitoring, we're attentive to the increase in longer-term yields,
 which have contributed to a tightening of broader financial conditions since the summer.
 As I mentioned, persistent changes in broader financial conditions can have
 implications for the path of monetary policy. In this case, the tighter financial conditions
 we're seeing from higher long-term rates, but also from
 other sources, like the stronger dollar and lower equity prices,
 could matter for future rate decisions as long as two conditions are satisfied.
 The first is that the tighter conditions would need to be persistent,
 and that is something that remains to be seen. But that's critical.
 Things are fluctuating back and forth. That's not what we're looking for.
 With financial conditions, we're looking for persistent changes that are material.
 The second thing is that the longer-term
 rates that have moved up, they can't simply be a reflection of expected policy moves from us,
 that we would then, that if we didn't follow through on them, then the rates would come back
 down. So the, and I would say on that, it does not appear that an expectation of higher near-term
 policy rates is causing the increase in longer-term rates.
 So in the meantime, though, perhaps the most important thing is that these higher Treasury
 yields are showing through to higher borrowing costs for households and businesses,
 and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this tightening
 persists. And, you know, the mind's eye goes to the 8 percent, near 8 percent mortgage rate,
 which could have, you know, pretty significant effect on housing.
 So that's how I would answer your question.
 Just as a quick follow-on, to be clear on this, in your opening statement and just now,
 you seem to imply that you are not yet confident that financial conditions are
 restrictive enough to finish the fight. Is that true?
 Yes, that's exactly right. You know, to say it a different way,
 we haven't made any decisions about future meetings.
 We have not made a determination, and we're not, I will say that we're not confident at this time
 that we've reached such a stance. We're not confident that we haven't.
 We're not confident that we have. And that's, that is, the way we're going to be going into
 these future meetings is to be, you know, just determining the extent of any additional further
 policy tightening that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time.
 Gina.
 Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions.
 I wonder, you know, if you don't raise interest rates in December,
 would the presumption be that at that point that we should expect that rates are at their peak,
 or is there a possibility of restarting rate increases next year?
 And are there any costs to taking a more extended pause?
 CHAIR POWELL.
 So, let me start by saying that, you know, we have a lot of interest rates that are at their peak,
 and we have a lot of interest rates that are at their peak.
 So, you know, we have a lot of interest rates that are at their peak.
 Let me start by saying we haven't made a decision about September.
 You're asking a hypothetical there.
 But we're going into this summer meeting.
 We'll get, as you know, two more inflation readings, two more labor market readings,
 some data on economic activity.
 And so we'll be taking and also the broader situation, the broader financial conditions
 situation and the broader world situation.
 We'll be looking at all those things as we make a decision in December.
 We haven't made that decision.
 I would say, though, that
 the idea that if you – the idea that you wouldn't – would be difficult to raise again
 after stopping for a meeting or two is just not right.
 I mean, the Committee will always do what it thinks is appropriate at the time.
 And, again, we haven't made any decisions about – at all about December.
 We didn't even – we didn't talk about making a decision in December today.
 Really, it was a decision for this meeting and understanding broader things.

 in the materials for today's meeting, and how much does this tightening
 in financial conditions substitute for rate hikes if the tightening is persistent?
 You had said it was worth maybe a quarter point when we had the bank failures in the spring.
 What is it here on something that's presumably more straightforward
 and more familiar to simulate?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
 So I guess I don't want to answer your question about the recession, but the answer is no.
 I think I have to answer it since we did publicly say in the minutes.
 You'll know anyway in the minutes.
 The staff did not put our session back in.
 I mean, it would be hard to see how you would do that if you look
 at the activity we've seen recently, which is not really indicative of a recession in the near term.
 In terms of how to think about translation into rate hikes,
 I think it's just too early to be doing that.
 And the main reason is we just don't know how persistent this will be.
 You can see how volatile it is.
 Different kinds of news will affect the level of rates.
 And I think any kind of an estimate that was, you know, precise would hang out there
 and have a great chance of looking wrong very quickly.
 So I think what we can say is that financial conditions have clearly tightened,
 and you can see that in the rates that consumers and households and businesses are paying now.
 And over time, that will have an effect.
 We just don't know how persistent it's going to be, and it's tough to try to translate that in a way
 that I'd be comfortable communicating.
 And so-
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
 Thank you.
 I think we've got more time left.
 I think we're almost at the end of our time.
 I'm sorry.
 I think we're almost at the end of our time.
 We've got about a minute left.
 I think we'll move forward with the question to how many rates-
 to how many rate hikes that is.
 MR. If I could follow up, I guess, what makes you confident-
 What makes you confident that tighter financial conditions will slow above trend growth
 when 500 basis points of rate hikes, QT, and a minor banking crisis have not thus far?
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
 Well, I just-that's, you know, the way our policy works is-and sometimes it works with lags,
 of course, which can be long and variable.
 see those effects, and you see those effects in the economy now. You see what's happening
 in the housing market. You're seeing that now. You'll see, if you look at surveys of
 people, it's not a good time, they think, to buy durable goods of various kinds because
 rates are so high now. I mentioned again we're getting reports from housing that the effects
 of this could be quite significant. But you're right. This has been a resilient economy,
 and it's, I think, been surprising in its resilience, and there are a number of possible
 reasons why that may be. Our job is to achieve maximum employment and price stability, and
 so we take the economy as it comes. It has been resilient, so we just take it as it is.
 Colby.
 Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. In terms of the thresholds that you've
 laid out of what could warrant further tightening, the additional evidence of persistently above
 trend growth.
 There's some kind of reversal in the recent easing of labor market tightness. That seems
 to suggest something more powerful than just one more quarter point rate hike would be
 necessary, and I'm just curious if that's how the committee sees it.
 So, we've identified those factors. Those are not meant to be the only factors or a
 specific test that we're going to be applying with some metrics behind it. Really, we're
 going to be looking at the broader picture.
 What's happening with our progress toward the 2 percent inflation goal? Is the labor
 market continuing to broadly cool off and achieve a better balance? We'll be looking at that.
 You know, growth, we look at growth insofar as it has implications for our two mandate goals.
 We look at that, and we look at broader financial conditions. So, we'll be looking at all of
 those things as we reach a judgment, you know, whether we need to further tighten policy.
 And if we do reach that judgment, then we will further tighten policy.
 And just in terms of the tightening of financial conditions, if that is having some kind of
 offsetting effect in terms of the need to.
 potentially again raise rates, what then is the potential impact on the trajectory
 of rate cuts? Could we see those maybe pulled forward or have to see more than what the
 September SEP indicated?
 So it's, the fact is, the committee is not thinking about rate cuts right now at all.
 We're not talking about rate cuts. We're still very focused on the first question, which
 is have we achieved a stance of monetary policy that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation
 down to 2 percent over time?
 Sustainably.
 That is the question we're focusing on.
 The next question, as you know, will be for how long will we remain restrictive?
 Will policy remain restrictive?
 And what we said there is that we'll keep policy restrictive until we're confident
 that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent.
 That'll be the next question.
 But honestly, right now, we're really tightly focused on the first question.
 The question of rates cuts just doesn't come up because I think the first, it's so important
 to get that first question.
 You know, as close to right as you can.
 Steve.
 Steve Leisman, CNBC.
 Mr. Chairman, I guess I had assumed that there was a tightening bias in the committee.
 You say in the statement you're looking to assess the appropriate stance of monetary
 policy, the extent to which you may need to hike additionally.
 You didn't say earlier that you were sufficiently restrictive.
 There were forecasts for two rate hikes among most members of the committee.
 I'm not sure if you're aware of that.
 I'm not sure if you're aware of that.
 I'm not sure if you're aware of that.
 I'm not sure if you're aware of that.
 I'm not sure if you're aware of that.
 I'm not sure if you're aware of that.
 I'm not sure if you're aware of that.
 I'm not sure if you're aware of that.
 But then you just said that, you know, we're, we don't, we haven't made a determination.
 Would you say the bias right now is neutral, that there is no disposition to hike again
 and that the Committee largely has moved off of this forecast for two hikes?
 Or for, I'm sorry, one additional hike?
 I think you're talking about one additional hike?
 Yeah.
 No, I wouldn't say that at all.
 I would say, I mean, the language, you know, looking at it here in determining the extent
 of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation 2 percent over time, it's
 a little bit more difficult.
 two percent over time that's the question we're asking so is it right to think of that as a
 hiking bias is still in the committee here we haven't used that term but it's fair to say
 that's the question we're asking is should we hike more it's not it's not you know and that
 that is the question and you're right that in september we wrote down one additional rate hike
 but you know we'll write down another forecast as you know in december
 chris uh thank you chris rugaber at associated press um well since the last meeting the auto
 workers strike has finished uh oil prices have leveled off uh and yet on the other hand you
 have the outbreak of war between uh israel and hamas how do you see all those factors
 taken together affecting the economy uh going forward how are you thinking about those um
 so there are significant issues out there as you as you
 point out um global uh geopolitical tensions are certainly elevated and that goes for the
 war in ukraine it goes for the war between israel and hamas uh we're monitoring that
 our job is to monitor those things for their economic uh implications um so the uaw strike
 as you point out is is um uh appears to be coming to an end well prices have flattened out they
 haven't gone down but i guess they've gone down a little bit from their earlier peak
 another one is the
 the possibility of government shutdown we don't know about that one so there's plenty of risk out
 there um but i would go back to the you know the bigger picture from our standpoint is is we've got
 a very strong economy strong labor market making progress on the labor market making progress on
 inflation and we're very focused on getting confident that we have achieved a stance of
 monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive that's really our focus
 just one quick thing you uh last month had gone to york pennsylvania where you talked to a lot of
 or yeah last month where you talked to a lot of small business owners just curious what
 sentiments did you hear from them or what did you picked up on and what would you was there
 anything that surprised you the most in terms of what they talked about i wouldn't say i was
 terribly surprised i was i was very impressed by york as a town with a real strategy and i
 would say it's it's very impressive what the people there have have put together
 face of you know some difficult longer run trends about offshoring of manufacturing and that kind of
 thing they've they've done a great job as a as a city i think you know what you hear and it is
 consistent there which is people are really suffering under high inflation you were there
 we talked to some people who you know were feeling that in their businesses and other
 people who are feeling it in their home lives as well you know it's it's painful for people
 particularly people who you know who don't have a lot of extra financial resources
 are spending most of their incoming uh you know income on uh the essentials of life so we know
 that that that wasn't new but that did come through very clearly uh in in in the conversations
 we had in new york and you know i i walked away from that even you know i mean just thinking that
 that we really the the best thing we can do for the us is to restore price stability uh
 fully restore price stability and not fail in that task and do it as
 quickly as possible but but also with the least damage we we can rachel
 hi chair powell rachel siegel from the washington post thanks for taking our questions
 you've spoken before about the pain that would likely be coming for the economy in order to get
 inflation down but since the economy has not responded to rate hikes in ways that would
 normally be expected have you changed your views on that at all on how necessary or inevitable that
 kind of pain would be say for the labor market or what would that be like for the labor market
 overall growth well i think everyone has been very gratified to see that we've been able to
 achieve you know pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of increase
 in unemployment that has been very typical of rate hiking cycles like this one so that's that's a
 historically unusual and and very welcome result and the same is true of growth you know we've
 we've been saying that we need to see below potential growth
 that's been strong but yet we're still seeing this i think i still believe and my colleagues
 for the most part i think still believe that it is likely to be true it is still likely to be true
 not a certainty but likely that we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the
 labor market in labor market conditions to get to you know to fully restore price stability so but
 it's it's only a good thing that we haven't seen and i think we know why you know since since we
 lifted off we we have you know we've you know we've you know we've you know we've you know we've
 understood that there are really two processes at work here one of them one of which is the
 unwinding of the distortions to both supply and demand from the pandemic and the response to the
 pandemic and the other is is you know restrictive monetary policy which is moderating demand and
 giving the supply side time to time to recover time and space to recover so you see those two
 forces now working together to bring down inflation but it's that that first one can bring
 down inflation without
 the need for higher unemployment or slower growth it's just it's supply you know supply side
 improvements like um shortages and bottlenecks and that kind of thing going away it's getting you
 know a significant increase in the size of the labor market now both from labor force participation
 and from immigration that's a big supply side you know gain that is really helping the economy
 that's part of why part of why gdp is so high is because we're getting that that supply so we welcome
 that um but i think those things will run their course and we're probably still going to be left
 we think and i think we'll still be left with it with some ground to cover to get back to full price
 stability and and that's where monetary policy and and what we do with demand is is still going to be
 important i'm curious against that backdrop if you've gotten any clarity on lags if you have an
 economy that's been so resilient to high rate increases does that suggest to you that there
 isn't necessarily this huge wave of tight
 that's still coming through the pipeline and that it may have already come into effect you know i
 continue to think it's very hard to say so it's been one year at this meeting one year ago this
 was the fourth of our 75 basis points hikes so that's a full year since then i think we are
 seeing the effects of of all the hiking we did last year and this year we're seeing it it's very
 hard to know exactly what that might be but you can for example an example of where you wouldn't
 have felt this yet is is debt that had been termed out uh but it's going to come due and have to get
 rolled over next year or the year after so and they're little things like that where the effects
 are just taking time to get into the economy so i don't i think we have to make monetary policy
 under great uncertainty about how long the lags are i think trying to make a clear get a clear
 answer and say i'm just going to assume this is really not a good way to do it and this is one
 of the reasons why we have slowed the process down this year
 was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy and it takes time we know that and you
 can't rush it so doing slowing down is giving us i think a better sense of of how much more we need
 to do if we need to do more michael mckee from bloomberg television and radio i'm trying to
 connect the dots here one quick clarification i want to ask about um rachel's question is
 you said you need slower growth you had always said before a period of lower than trend growth
 uh has that changed and two it sounds to me like uh you're basically saying here that the kind of
 the dot plots out the window that every meeting is live with the possibility of a rate increase
 for right now doesn't matter about the turn of the uh the year and that there's not an objective way
 to determine whether or not you've got enough uh tightening
 in the system it's just going to be a subjective judgment meeting by meeting well so let's talk
 about the dot plot first so the dot plot is a is a a picture in time of what the people in the
 committee thinks is likely to be appropriate monetary policy in light of their own personal
 economic forecast in principle when things change it's not that's not like a plan that anybody's
 agreed to or that we will do that's a forecast that would change for example i mean maybe
 things could change that would cause people to say i wouldn't write down that dot you know six
 weeks later think of the number of things that could change your mind on that so i think i think
 the the efficacy of the dot plot probably decays over the three months period between that meeting
 and the next meeting but nonetheless it's it's out there and we don't we do personally update
 our forecast but we don't formally update the dot plot so you know i think we try to be as
 transparent as we can about the way we're thinking about these things we're laying out there are
 a number of things that we're thinking about and you know as we approach the meeting we'll we'll
 all be you know my colleagues and i will be talking about how we're processing that data
 in terms of so we're not really changing the way in terms of uh growth uh what i said was below
 potential so what you have here recently is growth that is that is um temporarily potential growth
 is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level so the right way to think about it is
 is if we look at the the growth of the labor market this year are trend people think trend
 growth over a long period of time is a little bit less than two percent or i would say just around
 two percent but um what we've had is with with the you know improvement in the size of the labor
 force as i mentioned through both participation and uh immigration and with the the you know the
 better functioning in the labor market and with with uh you know the unwinding of the supply chain
 and shortages and those kinds of things you're seeing actually elevated potential growth there's
 There's catch-up growth that can happen in potential, and that means that if you're growing-you
 could be growing at 2 percent this year and still be growing below the increase in the
 potential output of the economy.
 I hope that's clear.
 That's really what's going on.
 That's why I would say it as below potential.
 But if you could clarify what I asked about meeting by meeting.
 We essentially now are supposed to assume that it's a meeting by meeting, live meeting
 with a chance of a rate increase that will be decided on subjective criteria rather than
 objective at each meeting.
 MR.
 I mean, I don't know that I want to just accept anybody's characterization of it.
 I'll tell you how we're doing this.
 So we're going meeting by meeting.
 We're asking ourselves whether we've achieved a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive
 to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.
 That's the question we're asking.
 We're looking at the full rate.
 We're looking at the full range of economic data, including financial conditions and all
 of those things that we look at.
 And then we're-you know, we've come very far with this rate hiking cycle, very far.
 And you saw the spread at the September meeting of, you know, it's a relatively small spread
 of people think one or two additional hikes.
 So you're close to the end of the cycle.
 That was an impression as of-a belief as of September.
 It's not a promise or a plan of the future.
 And so we're going into these meetings.
 One by one, we're looking at the data.
 As I mentioned, we're also-you know, we've-we're being-we're being careful.
 We're proceeding carefully because we can proceed carefully at this time.
 Monetary policy is restrictive.
 We see its effects, particularly in interest-intra-sensitive spending and other channels.
 So that's how I think about it.
 NIELE IRWIN.
 Thanks. Hi, Chair Powell.
 Niele Irwin with Axios.
 In light of the run-up in long-term yields we've seen the last several weeks,
 have you given any consideration
 to the pace of your asset runoff program?
 And if there were a judgment that higher-that the higher-term premium was endangering the
 dual mandate goals, would that be reason to think about slowing or suspending QT?
 Or should we think of that as more of a technical question around reserves?
 CHAIR POWELL.
 So Committee is not considering changing the pace of balance sheet runoff.
 It's not something we're talking about or considering.
 And I know there are-there are many candidate explanations for why rates have been going up.
 And QT is certainly on that list.
 It may be playing a role.
 CHAIR POWELL.
 I think it's a relatively small effect, although I would say at $3.3 trillion in reserves it's not-I
 think it's hard to make a case that reserves are even close to scarce at this point.
 So that's not something that we're looking at right now.
 VICTORIA GUIDA.
 Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico.
 I wanted to ask about the Basel III endgame capital proposal.
 You know, you've gotten a lot of pushback from people on different aspects of the proposal,
 and you yourself expressed some reservations.
 And I'm just curious, could you accept finalizing that proposal without significant changes?
 CHAIR POWELL.
 So that proposal is out for comment, and we expect a lot of comment.
 We won't get those comments until the end of-well, until well into next year.
 You know, we've extended the deadline.
 And we'll take them seriously.
 We'll read them.
 I'll say what I do expect is that we will-we will come to-we're a consensus-driven organization.
 We'll come to a package that has broad support.
 CHAIR POWELL.
 Thank you.
 CHAIR POWELL.
 And we'll come to a package that has broad support on the board.
 VICTORIA GUIDA.
 So does broad support mean more support than the proposal had?
 CHAIR POWELL.
 It means broad support.
 VICTORIA GUIDA.

 So in addition to persistence, when you look at long-term treasury yields,
 what else are you watching to evaluate how those tighter financial conditions are hitting the economy,
 and if it will lessen the need for further support?
 And if it will lessen the need for further tightening?
 Also, do you think that those higher yields could affect banking stress?
 CHAIR POWELL.
 So what do we look at?
 We look at a very wide range of financial conditions.
 In effect, as you'll know, different organizations publish different financial conditions indexes,
 which can have, you know, seven or eight variables, or they can have 100 variables.
 So there's a very rich environment.
 And we tend to look at a few of them.
 I'm not going to give you the names.
 But they're, you know, they're very rich.
 CHAIR POWELL.
 I'm going to give you a few of the common ones that people look at.
 And so they're looking at things like the level of the dollar, the level of equity prices,
 the level of rates, the credit spreads.
 Sometimes they're pulling in credit availability and things like that.
 So it isn't any one thing.
 We would never look at, for example, long-term treasury rates in isolation, nor will we ignore them.
 But we would look at them as part of a broader picture.
 And they do play a role, of course, in many of the major markets.
 And so we're looking at the financial conditions indexes, the standard financial condition indexes.
 Your second question was?
 MS. On the banking stress.
 CHAIR POWELL.
 Banking stress.
 So it's something we're watching.
 As you know, we did have-there were issues with interest rate risk and also, you know,
 funding uninsured deposits in the March, the things we went through in March and thereafter.
 And so we've been working a lot with financial institutions to make sure that they have good funding,
 good funding plans and good-and that they have a plan for how to deal with, you know,
 the kind of portfolio unrealized losses that they have.
 We do think the banking system is quite resilient.
 We had, you know, a handful of bank failures, but-so that's what we're out there doing.
 And we don't have any reason to think that these rate hikes are materially changing that picture,
 which is one of a strong banking system and one where there's a strong focus by banks
 and by supervisors on liquidity, on funding and those sorts of things.
 MS. Scott.
 MR. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
 Scott Horsley from NPR.
 Last week, you and your colleagues put forward a proposal to lower the cap on debit card swipe fees for comment.
 Could you just talk a little about the considerations there, what it would mean for merchants, for banks,
 for consumers, and also just what you all are seeing in terms of the use of both debit and credit cards?
 MR. You know, so you're right.
 We put a proposal out for comment is what we did.
 And, you know, this is a job that Congress assigned us, as you, of course, know, in Dodd-Frank.
 And all we can really do is faithfully implement the statute.
 That's all we're trying to do.
 What else can we really do?
 It's a 90-day comment period.
 We typically don't comment on these things once they're out for comment.
 And we do hope that stakeholders-and we know that they will use this opportunity to express their views.
 They haven't been able to.
 They've been shy about that.
 So that's critical, and that's what I can say about that now.
 EDWARD LAWRENCE.
 Thank you.
 Thanks, Chair.
 Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.
 So over the last three months, the year-over-year PCE inflation was at 3.4 percent,
 core well over 3 percent.
 You've said in the past 2 percent remains the Federal Reserve target.
 But with no rate increase today, how long would you be okay, then,
 with a 3 percent or 3 percent-plus overall inflation?
 CHAIR POWELL.
 You know, the progress-the progress-the progress-the progress,
 is probably going to come in lumps and be bumpy, but we're making progress.
 You know, I think-I think the core PCE came down by almost 60 basis points in the third quarter.
 So if you-the best thing I could point to you, too, would be the September SEP, where, you know,
 the expectation was that inflation by the end of next year on a 12-month trailing basis would be well
 into the twos, and the year after that, further into the twos.
 So that's-that's-if you look historically, that's-that's sort of consistent with the way inflation comes in.
 It does take some time.
 And as you get, you know, as you get further and further from those highs,
 it may actually take longer time.
 But the good news is we're-you know, we're making progress, and monetary policy is restrictive,
 and we feel like we're on a path to make more progress, and it's essential that we do.
 VICE CHAIRMAN.
 But you've said in the past that doing too little on interest rates could take years to fix, but the cost,
 of doing too much, could be easily fixed.
 How robust was the debate about this pause on the doing too little side?
 MR. That's always the-the question we're asking ourselves.
 And we know that if we-if we fail to restore price stability, the risk is that expectations
 of higher inflation get entrenched in the economy, and we know that that's really bad for people.
 Inflation will be both more-both higher and more volatile.
 That's-that's a prescription.
 It's a prescription for misery, and-and so we're really committed to not letting that happen.
 You know, for the first year or so of our tightening cycle, the risk was all on the side of not doing enough.
 We're-you know, we're-we've come far enough that-that the risks, you know, have gotten more two-sided.
 You can't identify that with a lot of precision, but it does feel like the risks are-are more two-sided now.
 And-but we're-we're committed to getting inflation back down to our target over time,
 and we will.
 MS.
 Simon.
 MR.
 Simon Urbinovich with The Economist.
 Quick follow-up to the question about banking stresses.
 You talked about how the banking system is resilient.
 Of course, part of the resilience of the past year stems from the-the bank term funding
 program that you launched in March.
 Given that bond prices have not recovered, that unrealized losses are probably mounting,
 how likely is it that you might have to extend that program in March next year?
 MR.
 Good question.
 We're-we haven't really-we haven't really been thinking about that yet.
 We-you know, it's-it's November 1, and that's a decision we'll be making in the first quarter
 of next year.
 MR.
 Great.
 Sorry.
 Quick separate question about inflation expectations.
 The U. Michigan Sentiment Survey showed a big jump in one-year ahead inflation expectations
 last month from 3.2 to 4.2.
 Last year, you said that particular survey was a really decisive factor in one of your
 rate hike decisions.
 If it stays elevated next time around?
 How big of an input will that be into your December thinking?
 MR.
 Yeah.
 We-we look at a-a range of-of things.
 I-I think the-the-the, you know, the UM thing got blown out of proportion a little bit.
 It was actually a preliminary estimate that got revised away.
 And-and I said it was preliminary in that, but that didn't get picked up.
 So, we-we look at many, many things.
 And so, really, look across the broad array of surveys and also market-based estimates.
 And, you know, and we do that really carefully at every meeting and between meetings.
 MR.
 Thank you.
 MR.
 You know, there-there's-it's just clear that inflation expectations are in a good place.
 The public does believe that-that inflation will get back down to 2 percent over time.
 And-and it will.
 They're right.
 So-and-and there's no real crack in that-in that armor.
 You can always find one reading that is a little bit out of whack.
 But-but honestly, the bulk of them are-are just very clear that-that the public believes
 that inflation will come down.
 And that's, of course, we-we believe that's critical.
 And winning the battle.
 MS.
 Megan.
 MS.
 Hi, Chair Powell.
 Megan Casella with Barron's.
 Thanks for taking our questions.
 I wanted to see if you could talk about the neutral rate.
 You mentioned today that you're still debating whether rates are sufficiently restrictive.
 And you've recently said that evidence is suggesting policy is not too tight right now.
 So, I was curious if you could elaborate on that at all and whether that means the neutral
 rate, in your view, has risen.
 CHAIR POWELL.
 Yeah.
 MS.
 Yeah.
 CHAIR POWELL.
 MS.
 Yeah.
 CHAIR POWELL.
 MS.
 Yeah.
 CHAIR POWELL.
 MS.
 Yeah.
 CHAIR POWELL.
 MS.
 Yeah.
 CHAIR POWELL.
 MS.
 Yeah.
 CHAIR POWELL.
 So, first thing to say is that it's very important-it's a very important variable
 in-in the way we think about monetary policy, but you can't identify it with any precision
 in real time.
 And we know that.
 So, you have to just take that-you have to take your estimate of it with a grain of salt.
 What we know now is, you know, within a range of estimates of the neutral rate, policy is-is
 restrictive.
 And it's, therefore, putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.
 So we do-we do talk about this.
 There's-we're-there's not any debate or, you know, attempt to, you know, to sort of agree
 as a group on what-whether our star has moved or not.
 Some people think it has.
 Some people haven't said-that don't think it has.
 Ultimately, it's-it's unknowable.
 And so, really, again, what we're focused on is, you know, looking at the data and giving
 ourselves a little more time now to look carefully at the data by being careful in
 our-in our moves, does it-does it feel like monetary policy is restrictive enough to bring
 inflation down to 2 percent over time?
 That's the question we're asking ourselves.
 I think, you know, years from now, economists will be revising their estimates of-of our
 star as it existed on November 1, 2023.
 You can't-we can't really wait for that in making policy.
 We have to look-we have to-we have to-we have to-we have to-we have to-we have to-we have
 to-we have to-we have to-we have to-we have to-we have to-we have to-we have to-we have to-we have
 to-we have to have those models and look at them and think about them.
 And ultimately, we've got to look at the effects of-that policies having, accounting for the
 lags, which makes it difficult.
 If I could follow up on a wages point earlier, you talked about the inflation outlook,
 but I'm curious if you have any concerns whether wage inflation at its current level could
 be-could risk pushing up overall inflation or re-acceleration?
 So if you look at the-look at the broad range of wages, they have-the wage increases have
 really come down.
 Right.
 Right.
 significantly over the course of the last 18 months to a level where they're substantially
 closer to that level that would be consistent with two percent inflation over time making
 standard assumptions about productivity over time so it's much closer than it was
 and that's true of the eci which is the one that's the one that we got this week it's true of um
 average hourly earnings and compensation per hour too so and all of them are kind of saying that
 which is great you have to look at a group of them because any one of them can be idiosyncratic
 from in any given reading so that's what you see uh and so what you saw with the eci reading was
 if you look if you look back a couple comes out four times a year if you look back a couple of
 quarters you'll see it was much higher and then it came down substantially in june and then september
 reading was more or less at the same level as the june reading so in a way it's just validating that
 decline and it was very close to our expectations internally too so i think we've felt
 good about that also i would say it isn't in my thinking it's not the case that that wages have
 been the principal driver of inflation um so far although i i think it's all i do think it's fair
 to say that as we go forward as monetary policy becomes more important relative to the supply side
 issues i talked about in the unwinding of the pandemic effects it may be that that the labor
 market is becomes more important over time too nancy
 hi nancy marshall genser with marketplace um chair paul are you now as concerned about
 overshooting and raising interest rates too much as you are about getting inflation down to the two
 percent target so i as i mentioned um i think for much of the last year and a half the concern was
 not doing too much to not doing enough it was not getting rates high enough in time
 to avoid having inflation expectations higher inflation expectations become entrenched so
 that was the concern i think we've reached a you know now more than 18 months into this
 you can see by the fact that we have slowed down although we're still we're still we're still
 trying to gain confidence in in what the appropriate stance is but you can see that
 um we think and i think that the risks are getting more balanced i'll just say that they're getting
 more balanced
 the risk of doing too much versus the risk of doing too little are getting are getting more
 closer to balance because policy is clear i think clearly restrictive at five and a quarter to five
 and a half percent that that range you're if you take off a mainstream estimate of the of the
 expected inflation take one year inflation you're going to see that you're going to see a real policy
 rate that is you know well above mainstream estimates of of a neutral policy rate now that's
 that's arithmetic it doesn't really what the proof is really in how the economy reacts but i i would
 say that we're we're in a place where where those risks are getting closer to being in balance and
 you said the proof is how the economy reacts what are you looking at to be sure you're not
 overshooting well i think what we're looking at is are are we still is inflation still
 broadly cooling do we is it sort of validating the the path we saw over the
 summer uh where inflation was clearly cooling and coming down now we've seen periods like that
 before and they've just there hasn't been follow through the data have bounced back so
 what are we seeing you know are we are we seeing is inflation still coming down so that's the first
 thing second thing is in the labor market um what we've seen is a very positive rebalancing
 of supply and demand partly through just much more supply coming online and and with with labor
 demand still clearly remaining very strong when you're when you have the kind of job growth we've
 had over the last quarter it's still very strong demand so and you see wage increases coming down
 as we we discussed but coming out coming down you know in a kind of gradual way um i think
 that's we want to see that that whole set of processes continue brian thank you brian minna cnn
 do you think that there's has been any structural change in either consumption or in the job market
 that's uh pushing a consumption uh you obviously saw the third quarter gdp figures which were strong
 and some economists have expected everyone spending to fizzled out by now so i'm kind
 of wondering if uh there's been any structural change in consumption um i wouldn't say there's
 been a structural change in consumption i would say it's certainly um been strong and
 so a couple of things we may have underestimated the the balance sheet strength of households and
 small businesses and that may be part of it there may be you know we've been like everyone else
 trying to estimate the number of the amount of savings that that that households have from the
 pandemic when they couldn't spend on services really at all or you know in person services
 and you know there can still be more of that than we think although at a certain point we have to
 get back to pre-pandemic levels of savings we may not be there yet so things are for clearly people
 are still spending the dynamic has been really strong job creation with now wages that are that
 are higher than inflation in the aggregate anyway and that raises real disposable income and that
 raises spending which continues to drive more hiring and so you've had a really that whole
 that whole dynamic has been and also at the same time
 the pandemic effects are wearing off so that goods availability automobile availability is better or
 was better i think it still is and they're and from a from a business standpoint they're more
 people to hire and it's more labor supply so the whole thing has led to more growth more spending
 and that kind of thing and it's been you know it's been good and the thing is we've been achieving
 progress on inflation in the middle of this so um it's been a dynamic the question is how long can
 that continue and you know i just think this the the existence of this second set of factors
 at this time which is the unwinding of the pandemic effects that's what makes this
 cycle uh unique i think and you know we're still learning uh it that that took longer for that
 process to begin than we thought and we're still learning about how it plays out that's that's all
 we can do sort of daniel for the last question
 thank you thank you chair bell um daniel levis from uh agence france press um just a quick
 question following up uh on an earlier one um uh with regards to the israel uh hamas conflict um
 you know the fed's financial stability report said the israel hamas conflict and the conflict
 in ukraine pose important risks to global economic activity including the possibility
 of sustained disruptions to regional trade and food energy and other commodities you've had
 organizations at the world bank warning of a possible you know surge in the future and what's
 oil prices if the war spreads to other countries in the region i'm just wondering how the fed is
 monitoring these developments in the middle east you mentioned they are and and just what you know
 the potential economic impact could be if the conflict does spread to other countries in the
 region thank you i wouldn't want to speculate too much but i'll just say so you know really
 the question there is does the war spread more widely and does it start to do things like affect
 oil prices in particular since this is the middle east we're talking about the price of oil has
 really not reacted very much so far to this as you know as the fed as the federal open
 market committee our job is really to talk about to understand the economy and economic effects
 and it's it isn't clear at this point that the conflict in the middle east is going to is on
 track to have significant economic effects that doesn't mean it isn't incredibly important
 and something for people to you know to take take great really important notice of but it may or
 may not turn out to be something that matters for the federal open market committee as an economic
 body but the what so what the financial stability report does is it calls out risks and that's what
 it's doing is calling out a risk of that and the war in ukraine the same war in ukraine you know
 did have immediately very significant macroeconomic implications because of the connection to
 commodities so thank you
 thank you thanks very much
