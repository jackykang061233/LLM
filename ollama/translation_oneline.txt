You've said that broad and material changes are needed for the Basel III endgame proposal, and a re-proposal is on the table. With more time to consider public comments and options, do you believe a re-proposal will be necessary? Is there a timeline in mind for moving forward with this process? The Federal Reserve remains committed to completing the Basel III endgame while maintaining comparability with other major jurisdictions. No decisions have been made yet, but if a re-proposal is deemed appropriate, it will not be hesitated upon. The focus on resolving issues within the capital proposal doesn't hinder progress on other regulatory agenda items; however, Basel III holds significant importance in our current efforts.
